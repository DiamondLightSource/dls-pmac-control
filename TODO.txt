Python3 and Qt5 port - giles knap 27 Jun 2019

Fully working except for the below, but only with limited testing.

Still todo:
Non-incremental jogging (requires signal/slot rewiring, maybe different on Qt5)
Gather screen (needs a replacement for Qwt plot widget)
Not yet tried releasing under DLS pipenv scheme
Complete PEP8 and pycharm warnings cleanup

$$$ crashes:-
